    "Healthcare fraud is a pervasive issue affecting healthcare systems globally, including South Africa. One of the most concerning forms of fraud in South Africa is related to medico-legal claims, which involve healthcare providers, often in collaboration with patients and legal professionals, filing fraudulent claims for compensation. These fraudulent activities not only burden the healthcare system but also lead to financial losses for insurance companies and government health programs.Medico-legal fraud in South Africa typically involves cases where medical professionals inflate claims, bill for services that were never provided, or misrepresent the nature of treatments to secure higher payouts. These practices contribute to soaring healthcare costs and place an unnecessary strain on already limited public health resources. Given the complexity of these fraud cases and the significant financial impact they have on the healthcare system, there is a pressing need for an advanced fraud detection model that can accurately identify and flag potentially fraudulent claims. This project aims to address that need by developing a data-driven solution using claims data to detect healthcare fraud effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building a fraud detection model for medico-legal claims in the South African healthcare system. The model will be trained using data from inpatient claims, outpatient claims, and beneficiary details. By analyzing patterns and trends in the data, the project seeks to identify suspicious behaviors and potential fraud schemes orchestrated by healthcare providers.The main goal is to create a predictive model capable of detecting fraudulent claims and understanding the variables that play a critical role in identifying these fraudulent activities. Although the dataset used for this project is not sourced from South Africa, the techniques and insights developed through the model will be applicable to the South African context and can aid in the fight against healthcare fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dataset Overview:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of three primary components—Inpatient Data, Outpatient Data, and Beneficiary Details—used to detect potentially fraudulent behaviors in medico-legal claims. Each dataset provides unique insights that, when combined, can help identify fraudulent patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inpatient Data:\n",
    "Contains claims from patients admitted to hospitals, including admission and discharge dates, diagnosis codes, and services provided during the hospital stay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outpatient Data:\n",
    "Captures claims from patients who were not admitted but visited healthcare providers for various treatments. It includes details on diagnoses and outpatient services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beneficiary Details:\n",
    "Comprises patient-specific information, such as medical history, demographic details, and regional data, which can offer insights into the background and health profiles of claimants."
